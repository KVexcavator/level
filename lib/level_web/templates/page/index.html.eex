    <p>Hi, I&rsquo;m
      <img src="<%= static_url(@conn, "/images/derrick-500.jpg") %>" alt="Pic" class="ml-1 -mt-1 w-7 h-7 rounded-full align-middle" />
      Derrick, the creator of Level, an alternative to real-time chat optimized for deep work.</p>

    <p>For the past year, I&rsquo;ve been working on solving the distraction epidemic in the modern workplace.</p>
    <p>Thousands of folks reserved their username and hundreds of companies I spoke to recognized deep problems with real-time chat. But despite all the positive signals, I&rsquo;ve made the decision to step back from Level.</p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re interested, <a class="font-bold text-blue" href="https://www.derrickreimer.com/essays/2019/05/17/im-walking-away-from-the-product-i-spent-a-year-building.html">I wrote an in-depth retrospective to tell the whole story.</a></p>

    <h2 class="pt-6 pb-3 text-3xl sm:text-4xl tracking-semi-tight">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

    <p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but I know that I&rsquo;m passionate about serving the needs of makers (developers, designers, founders, indie hackers, and the like). Perhaps there&rsquo;s a way to deliver on the Level vision that is compatible with my goals â€“ I am exploring that as well.</p>

    <p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure: I will continue openly documenting what I&rsquo;ve learned, with the hope of helping others achieve their entrepreneurial goals.</p>
