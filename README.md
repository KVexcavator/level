## Project Status

Level began with the ambitious idea of [solving the problems](https://www.derrickreimer.com/essays/2018/03/02/the-war-on-developer-productivity.html) caused by real-time communication tools. After pouring thousands of hours effort into the cause, I made the tough decision to move on from the project. 

[Read the full story here &rarr;](https://www.derrickreimer.com/essays/2019/05/17/im-walking-away-from-the-product-i-spent-a-year-building.html)

This codebase is a full-scale Elixir/Phoenix SaaS application with a single-page app Elm front-end. I hope it will live on as a helpful resource for the community.

&mdash; Derrick Reimer, Founder

## Developer Setup

You'll need to install the following dependencies first:

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) ([version](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/mix.exs#L4))
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresapp.com/) 10
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) ([latest](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable))
- [Node](#nodejs) ([version](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/.nvmrc))

Run the bootstrap script to install the remaining dependencies and create your
development database:

```
cd level
script/bootstrap
```

If your local PostgreSQL install does not have a default `postgres` user, open the `config/dev.secret.exs` file and update the credentials. Then, run the bootstrap script again.

Use the `script/server` command to start up your local server and visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

### Installing Node.js

This repository includes a `.nvmrc` file targeting a specific version of Node
that is known to be compatible with all current node dependencies. Things might work
with a newer version of Node, but the most guaranteed route is to install
[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) and run `nvm install` from
the project root.

Then, be sure to run `script/bootstrap` to install node dependencies with the
correct version of node.

### Running tests and analyses

We have a handful of helper scripts available:

- `script/elixir-test`: runs the Elixir test suite with coveralls
- `script/elm-test`: runs the Elm test suite
- `script/test`: runs the Elixir and Elm test suites
- `script/static-analysis`: runs Credo (Elixir linting), Dialyzer, and Elixir formatter verification
- `script/build`: runs all the test suites and static analysis

## Documentation

Run the `script/docs` to generate and view the project ExDocs locally.

## Heroku Deployment (Experimental)

One of our goals is to make self-installation as painless as possible for those who are interested in hosting their own instance.

The relevant configuration files for Heroku live here:

- [app.json](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/app.json)
- [elixir_buildpack.config](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/elixir_buildpack.config)
- [phoenix_static_buildpack.config](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/phoenix_static_buildpack.config)
- [Procfile](https://github.com/levelhq/level/blob/master/Procfile)

We are aiming to keep seamless Heroku deployment up-to-date, with a few important "alpha software" notes:

- It's possible you may find it broken on master. If you do, please file an issue.
- As deployment needs grow more complex, it may become no longer feasible to support Heroku deploys. Caveat emptor.

### Required additional services

In addition to a Heroku account, you'll need the following services to get your Heroku install up and running:

- An AWS account and an S3 bucket for storing file uploads. You'll be asked for AWS API keys and bucket name environment variables during setup.
- A transactional email provider (we recommend [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com)). You'll be asked for SMTP host, port, username, and password environment variables during setup.
